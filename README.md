# * React_Native_Assignment *

# This is a react native app which takes input as First name, Last name 
# age, Date of birth, Occupation, Company name and returns all the  
# details as the output.
  
  1. I have imported react-native-datepicker attribute to calculate age from 
     Date of Birth input type.
     
  2. react-navigators have also been imported to navigate and pass parameters
     between screens.
     
  3. getParams function has been used for parsing paramters.
  
  4. I have taken five parameters - first_name, last_name, DOB, occupation 
     and company_name for taking user input.
